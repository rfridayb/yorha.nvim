# /!\ WIP, probably does not work

First try at a Neovim theme.
Going for a palette recreating Nier: Automata's design.

Took the plugin definition from [gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim) for educational purposes until I get a better understanding of how lua plugins for nvim work.
